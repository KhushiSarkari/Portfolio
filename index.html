              <h4>Season 8</h4>
              <h3>Fadeout</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">The final episode of the series is the best finale for Arrow out of all of them that have
                happened. Following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, “Fadeout” continued the emotional fallout with
                Oliver still dead in this new Earth. The series finale reveals several changes that Oliver did to
                Earth-Prime’s continuity, primarily through the resurrection of a lot of dead characters who had been
                integral to Arrow since the start. But in the end, Oliver still stayed dead as the world comes to terms with
                the Green Arrow’s passing and the sacrifice he made.</p>

              <h4>Season 2</h4>
              <h3>Unthinkable</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">
                Season 2 still gets recognized as being one of Arrow’s best seasons as it fleshed out this version of the DC
                Universe further. With Slade Wilson (Manu Bennett) finally getting to take the lead as big bad, the
                Deathstroke arc was one of the more enjoyable long-arcs for the series in retrospect. While the show got
                fleshed out by expanding the main characters’ roles and introducing new players, season 2 was a bundle of
                joy. It was this season that began the official birth of the Arrowverse as Grant Gustin’s Barry Allen made
                his entry early on, setting up The Flash..

              <h4>Season 5</h4>
              <h3>Lian Yu</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">
                Season 5 served, in many ways, as a soft relaunch for the series after season 3 and 4 were received with
                mixed feelings. After returning to what made Arrow as strong as it was, the fifth season succeeded with
                powerful stories, a remarkable big bad in Prometheus (Josh Segarra) and more.
